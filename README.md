🔍 Project Summary
This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing a passenger dataset by applying essential data preprocessing techniques and insightful feature engineering.

🧹 Data Preprocessing & Transformation

Addressed missing values by filling the 'Age' column using the median, and the 'Embarked' column using the mode, preserving data accuracy.

Eliminated less meaningful or redundant columns such as 'Name', 'SibSp', 'Parch', and 'Ticket' to simplify the dataset.

Engineered a new feature called 'FamilySize' by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch' to better capture group dynamics.

Extracted and refined 'Title' information from the 'Name' field to retain valuable social indicators while managing high-cardinality features.

📊 Data Visualization
Created a variety of visual representations to explore survival patterns across different passenger classes, genders, and newly engineered features like family size and title.
